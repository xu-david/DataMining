# Title       : CSCI573 Assignment 5
# Author      : David Xu (yx5)
# Description : Python implementation of the SVM training
#               algorithm (Algorithm 21.1). The dual form is
#               solved using stochastic gradient ascent and
#               hinge loss.

----------

Usage: ./assign5.py -i <inputFile> -k <KernelType>

Available Kernels:
  linear   Linear
  quad     Quadratic (Homogeneous)

----------

The program reads in a path to the comma-delimited input
and the name of a kernel from the list provided. At this
time, only the linear and homogeneous kernels are
available.

Example outputs are provided in the ./out/ directory for
the following three combinations:

Input File          Kernel              Output
iris-slwc.txt       linear              iris-slwc_linear.out
iris-slwc.txt       quad                iris-slwc_quad.out
iris-PC.txt         quad                iris-PC_quad.out
